									<h3>Client Website & Shopify Webhook Integration</h3>
									<p>
										A client was selling access to an online event,
										I integrated a Shopify Webhook to the backend of their website and wrote
										some logic (mostly in JS) so users would be emailed/invited
										to complete registration by filling out a custom form. Saving all
										requested information to their database... then they cancelled the event.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project was being developed at a subdomain that no longer exists but I have 
										packaged the relevant code into a .zip folder for review. The project was taken down 
										when it was cancelled so a demo version no longer exists unfortunately.

									<h3>EctorGrow.com</h3>
									<p>
										This website helps users organize and manage their personal cannabis grow.
										Allowing users to 'add' information about their plants, growing spaces and more. This
										allowed users to track the development of their plants and manage it accordingly.
										I originally had two goals for this project, 
										develop a tool that would help me manage my person grow and to further my development skills. 
									</p>

									<p>
										When I had a rough working version, I decided 
										to build the functionality for individual users, login/logout and more added features like user customized 
										nutrient charts. While planning out a bit of a redesign and adding features, I decided to refactor the project using React.

									<h3>Ector Grow refactor using React & Firebase</h3>
									<p>
										As I mentioned, I decided to refactor my EctorGrow.com project using React and Firebase, this turned into 
										more of a complete redesign and with very little of the original code being reused. I am also giving 
										the website a much needed redesign and adding new features that were planned for but never fully implemented before.
									</p>
									<p>
										I would eventually like to open this website up for user registration as I have added and am working on some features 
										that I think would be very helpful for users. I would also love to use this platform to advocate for responsible 
										consumption, legal reform and perhaps most importantly, allowing the full research of cannabis plants.

											as an oppurtunity to test out GitHub Pages. The personal version includes links to website I routinely visit, some general info
											and my favorite part - it has PDF versions of all my favorite recipes, making them super easy to find, organize and share.
											The Developer version has more resouces for development, especially to documentation for different programming languages and development.
