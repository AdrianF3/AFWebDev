									<h3>Client Website & Shopify Webhook Integration</h3>
									<p>
										In order for a client to sell access to an online event,
										I integrated a Shopify Webhook to the backend of their website and wrote
										some logic (mostly in JS) which allowed users to be emailed/invited
										to complete registration by filling out a custom form. Saving all
										requested information to a database for review before the event.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project is still viewable at DismantleYourDoubt.com, however the 
										backend integrations have been disabeled. Althgouh it is not interactive, 
										you can still view the entire project by following the demo instuctions below.

									<h3>EctorGrow.com</h3>
									<p>
										This website helps users organize and manage their personal cannabis grow.
										Allowing users to 'add' information about their plants, growing spaces and more. This
										allowed users to track the development of their plants and manage it accordingly.
										I had two goals for this project: 
										develop a tool that would allow me manage my personal grow and further my development skills. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Once I had a working version, I decided 
										to build the functionality for individual users, login/logout and more added features like user customized 
										nutrient charts. While planning out a redesign and adding features, I decided to refactor the entire project using React.

									<h3>Ector Grow refactor using React & Firebase</h3>
									<p>
										As I mentioned, I decided to refactor my EctorGrow.com project using React and Firebase. This turned into 
										more of a complete rewrite with very little of the original code being reused. I am also giving 
										the website a much needed redesign and adding new features that were planned for, but never fully implemented before.
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm planning to open this website up for user registration as I have added and am working on some features 
										that would be very helpful for users. In the future this platform will advocate for responsible 
										consumption, legal reform and allowing the full research of cannabis plants.

											<span class="darkText">Personal & Developer Resouces</span> - I created simple, static websites that would be more of a 
											utility for myself, also used this
											as an oppurtunity to test using a GitHub Pages website. The personal version includes links to websites I routinely visit, general info
											and my favorite part - PDF versions of all my favorite recipes, making them super easy to find, organize and share.
											The Developer version has more resouces for development, especially to documentation for different programming languages and development.											
										</li>

										<li style="list-style: none;">
											<span class="darkText">'BakeryNearMe'</span> - A website I developed using WordPress and some plugins. It eventually allowed users to locate a bakery near them. I worked on the SEO for a few months
											and was able to sell the website.
										</li>
										<li style="list-style: none;">
											<span class="darkText">Client Experience</span> - I worked for a small veterinary office in 2020 via Upwork. I updated a form
											and corrected an issue that existed with one of their buttons. I also worked with a client to integrate a Shopify store with a
											custom built registraion for private events, that I described in more detail above.
