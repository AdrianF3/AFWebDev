        Business, Technology & Helping Your Project or Business.
      </h3>
      <p class="aboutMeText">
        Helping others pursue their passion has always motivated me which is why I’ve worked to make things as easy for you as possible. I believe that having a website for your passion project or small business does’t need to be difficult OR break the bank.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutMeText">
        This is also why I have worked to make the entire process as easy as possible - you can be as involved (or not) as you want to be throughout the entire process - whatever you chose, all you’ll ever need to do is communicate with me about the changes you’d like to implement in your website.
